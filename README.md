# FancyGallery App

FancyGallery is an app that presents pets photo using UITableView.

## Highlights
- The app is well-commented, clean code and well-structured using MVC pattern.
- The most challenging feature that I'm prouder of developing it's the zoom in and dragging the image. First, the user needs to touch the photo that he wants to zoom in. It will take him to a dialog where he can pinch the image to zoom in/out and dragging around.
- It connects with a REST back end to fetch the data using https://www.mocky.io/
- The app provides a share button and a favourite feature that uses UserDefaults to store the photos.
- The app is responsive in a way that fits either iPhones and iPads.
- The pod ‘SDWebImage’ was used to manage the image downloading and caching.
